# e-challenge_sqli_Evelator
 *   * This test is about a building having several elevators with different states.  * For example, each elevator can be at a different level, and can be going up,  * or down.  * &lt;/p>  *   * The objective of this exercise is to write a program that will identify which  * elevator will be served once a request for an elevator is registered.  * &lt;/p>  *   * Please note these rules : &lt;/br>  * - An elevator is requested by default from floor &lt;b>zero&lt;/b>. &lt;/br>  * - An elevator can be resting at a given floor, going up or going down. &lt;/br>  * - An elevator switch automatically his direction when reaching the edges of  * the building (means the first and top floors). &lt;/br>  * - An elevator can not switch his direction in the middle of a building.  * Example: in a building of 10 floors, an elevator at the 3rd floor and  * ascending can never go down before reaching the 10th floor. And vice  * versa.&lt;/br>  * - An elevator is never in between floors.
